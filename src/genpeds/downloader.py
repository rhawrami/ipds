    ## available data

    - :characteristics: institutional characteristics, like a school's name, address. Certain variables, like a school's longitude and latitude are only available in later years. Available for years 1984-2023.

    - :admissions: Admissions data, like number of applications and acceptances by gender. Available for years 2001-2023.

    - :enrollment: fall enrollment by gender and institutional level (e.g., 4-year undergraduate program), with most years including enrollment by race and gender. Available for years 1984-2023.

    - :completion: completion of degrees by gender, level of degree and subject field (e.g., Bachelor's in Economics), with most years including completion by race and gender. Available for years 1984-2023.

    - :cip: CIP, or Classification of Instructional Programs, are key-value pairs for subject study fields. CIP's vary by year, and are relevant to identify subject field in completion data. Available for years 1984-2023.

    - :graduation: number of cohorts and graduates by gender, institutional level and graduation measure (e.g., students earning a bachelor's degree within 6 years of entering). Available for years 2000-2023.
